# Basic-MPC-based-on-CasAdi-for-a-mass-point-vehicle-model
This is a Matlab and CasADi based Model Predictive Control (MPC) implementation for a kinematic vehicle model. The primary goal of this control is to drive the vehicle to follow a predefined reference point with minimum deviation, while considering the constraints of the vehicle and controls.
